This is an fMRI-pattern-analysis following the tutorial from [NI-edu]((https://lukas-snoek.com/NI-edu/index.html)), developed by the University of Amsterdam using data from [kaggel](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/3t-fmri-dataset/data).

The data wasn't provided for the course I had to modify the existing data slighly.
